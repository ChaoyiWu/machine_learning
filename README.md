# machine_learning
a collection of all machine learning work:
- Use Google Colab for Token classification. 
  Fine tune BERT pretrained model using huggingface trainer API with The CoNLL-2003 dataset.
  
- GenAI with LLM: Use AWS SageMaker for the laboratory
  Model: Flan-T5 PERF/LoRA for fine tuning, RoBERTa
  Evaluation: ROUGE metrics
  Use cases: Tokenization, Summarization, Infenrence, Sentiment Analysis

- ml_use_cases:
  This is a folder includes all exercises I've practiced to apply different machine learning modeling to applications that I am interested. For example, rating system, image compression, etc.
